Dev here doesn't mean developer if you were wondering

I'm 17 years old and am learning how to code. I'm learning java at the moment, and would consider my self on a beginner level. </br>
I plan on learning web-development after this and more languages down the line, unless I get bored and quit.

I also play video games, mostly shooters & minecraft and enjoy playing piano.
